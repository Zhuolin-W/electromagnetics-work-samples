# electromagnetics-work-samples
I am providing work samples of electromagnetic, RF, antenna, and radar system analysis that I performed for graduate school assignments and public industry presentations.

## Electromagnetics Work Samples

Welcome to the Electromagnetics Work Samples repository. This repository is a collection of work samples, experiments, and projects in the field of electromagnetics. While I cannot share proprietary work samples from past employers, this aims to provide samples of past work.

Please see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SZPSZm0AAAAJ&hl=en) profile for a comprehensive list of academic journal and conference presentation.
